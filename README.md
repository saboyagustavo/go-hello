# go-hello
Through this project I practiced Go fundamentals and deploy with a multistage built and optimized image

## Running the program
```
  docker pull saboyagustavo/go-hello

  docker run -it saboyagustavo/go-hello
```

## Outcomes
It is expected to print on terminal the following sequence:
```
Hello world!
This program is running in its 1.1 version
Enter your name:
 - Lorem
Enter your age:
- 72
Got:  72
Hello Lorem your age is 72
Thank you, see in the next version! Hopefully 1.2 version
```
